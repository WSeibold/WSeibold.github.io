      Currently based in Evanston, IL, Weston is a second year business school student at the JL Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Northwestern University.  With less than a year left until resuming a productive carreer in real world Weston needs to maximize international adventure in the short time he has available.

      <h3>Background</h3>
      
      <p> Originally from the metropolis of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Iowa" target="_blank">Waterloo, Iowa</a> - the sixth largest city in Iowa and the most advanced city in the United States that contains the zip code 50701.  This is where the magic all began!</p>

      <p> Weston graduated from the the highest ranked and most well known University ever to be based in a former but no longer current capital of Iowa, the great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ANP8g8wrE" target="_blank">University of Iowa</a> where he studied Finance, Economics, and Philosophy and expanded his knowledge of excellent life living outside the classroom.  A lifelong Iowa Hawkeye fan, Weston endeavors to make an annual pilgrimage back to the Historic Kinnick Stadium.</p>

      <p> After Graduation, Weston relocated to Chicago where he excelled as an investment banking analyst and most recently as an private equity associate.  Throughout his five year carreer prior to Kellogg, Weston contributed to and helped advise on the  acquisition of numerous companies and developed a diverse and outstanding business acumen.
